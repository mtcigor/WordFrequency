NEW YORK, NY, June 28, 2024 – On Wednesday, June 26, the Federal Reserve notified the firm of the Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) of 6.4%, resulting in a Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio requirement of 13.9%, which will become effective on October 1, 2024.

“This increase does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we’ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in the last three tests. We will engage with our regulator to better understand their determinations,” said Chairman and CEO David Solomon. “We continue to be well-positioned to support our clients as they navigate the challenges of a dynamic market environment. Our capital management philosophy prioritizes investing in our world-class interconnected businesses at accretive returns while prudently navigating the economic, regulatory, and geopolitical landscape.”

The firm’s capital plan includes an increase in the common stock dividend from $2.75 to $3.00 per share beginning July 1, 2024, demonstrating confidence in the durability of our franchise. This increase is subject to approval by the firm’s Board of Directors at the customary third quarter meeting.
